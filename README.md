# RoomBuilder
This is a project mostly to work on my understanding of 2D arrays.

Use the command line to create and edit a top down view of a room.
Furniture can be created and moved in next to the chosen door location and moved around the room.
Objects require the appropriate space to move, so space planning is needed for many furniture objects.


***In Progress***

Items left to complete before program is interactive:
- Menu class
- Inventory class
